Hi ðŸ˜„! 

My name is Paul Kim, and I am a Junior studying Computer Science and Mathematical Finance at the University of Southern California. In my GitHub repo, I organized a repository for all the school projects that I have been working on so far.

**Tech Stacks:**

**Backend:** Java, Python, C++/C, Spring, Relational Databases (SQL, MySQL, MongoDB).

**Frontend:** JavaScript, React.js, Bootstrap, Software as a Service (Saas), HTML5/CSS3.

**Tools:** AWS, Azure, Docker, Git, Figma, Firebase, AirTable, Softr.io.

As for technical experiences:

I am currently a Software Engineer intern for the Scholars of Finance National Team (https://scholarsoffinance.org). 
  - Currently developing and working to develop new systems and applications to improve the efficiency and delivery of the SOF platform.
 
I am an Undergraduate Research Assistant for USC's Information Science Institute (ISI) under Dr. Luis Garcia (https://www.isi.edu).
  - Currently involved in the STEEL Lab focusing in the Cyber Security Space (https://steel.isi.edu).
  - Directly involved in the SMELL-CPS Project (Reverse Engineering Source Code), and the NeuroloT Project (Neurological/Human Alignment with IoT).

I am a Frontend Developer for USC's Trojan Event Services (https://trojanevents.usc.edu).
  - Currently working alongside the Assistant Director of the Trojan Event Services to help build out the TES website content, design, and system (Link attached is the old site, that I am trying to fix).

I was involved in the 2022 IMC Trading Launchpad Program (May 2022) where I developed mathematics, probability, and problem-solving skills at the IMC headquarters in Chicago, IL. 

I am also one of the 100 rising juniors selected for Target's 2022 Diversity Leadership Symposium - Software Engineering focusing on diversity, inclusion, and development in August 2022.
